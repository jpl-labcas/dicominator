# ðŸ“œ Dicominator COntent

This is a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) app ([Python](https://www.python.org/) package) that provides some basic content types for the Dicominator. This is just to make using the app more pleasant by providing basic pages in-between the actual tag and other data pages.

The Dicominator is an app for [LabCAS](https://edrn-labcas.jpl.nasa.gov/) which is itself an app of the [Early Detection Research Network](https://edrn.nci.nih.gov/).
