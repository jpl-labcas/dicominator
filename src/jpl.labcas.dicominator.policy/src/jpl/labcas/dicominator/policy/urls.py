# Note: we wouldn't normally want to serve static files or media out of the `urlpatterns` listed
# here. This means that the Django app is doing unnecessary work. However, in order to Dockerize
# this app, it does make sense to at laeast provide a fallback for Django (+ wsgi + gunicorn) to do
# the work in order to be completely containerized.
#
# So we do include the static files and media URL patterns to support this. However, in an optimal
# deployment, the ALB (or Nginx or Apache HTTPD or whatever) would intercept /static and /media URLs
# and serve them directly out of the host filesystem.
